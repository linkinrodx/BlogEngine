# Blog Engine v1

Welcome to Blog Engine project, in this project to will have the opportunity of manage the flow of some posts and finally publish a post.

If you want to load the project here, to will have to do some task:

## First let's see the prerequisites

- Visual Studio with net core 5
- Sql Server 2012+

And now we are going to do:

### Create the database

Execute the Scripts/script1.sql in your SQL Server

### Change Connection String in appsettings (for BlogEngine and BlogEngine.Security)

Example:       Data Source=(servername);Initial Catalog=BlogEngine;Integrated Security=True;

And now you will have the opportunity to load the projects (BlogEngine and BlogEngine.Security)

## What can you do with the project? let's see!

Inside, you can see 2 solutions with some endpoints

- BlogEngine 
- BlogEngine.Security

### Security Endpoints

Here you can login and generate a security token 

[Post] GetToken

### BlogEngine Endpoints

These are all the endpoints, to use these you must add the authorization header request (add the token created before)

```
- All Roles
[Get]   GetListPost

- Writer Role
[Get]   GetListPostByAuthorId
[Post]  AddPost
[Put]   EditPost
[Put]   SubmitPost

- Editor Role
[Get]   GetListPostSubmmited
[Put]   ApprovePost
[Put]   RejectPost
```

## Test Users

With these users you can request for all the endpoints (use the users in security endpoints)

- Public1     :     Public123
- Writer1     :     Writer123
- Editor1     :     Editor123

## An aditional point (Post Flow)

All the posts follow a flow state (depending of the post state, you can use some endpoints)

1. Created
2. Submitted
3. Approved
4. Rejected
5. Published
6. Deleted

```
When you load the project, you'll see the openapi documentation (swagger). There are some example images in the image folder where you can see how to use it
```
